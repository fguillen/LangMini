Here are some common answers:\n\n1. **Blue**: During the daytime, when the sun is overhead, the sky typically appears a shade of blue, known as cerulean blue. This is because the Earth's atmosphere scatters sunlight in all directions, and blue light is scattered more than other colors.\n2. **Golden/Hazy**: During sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of golden, orange, pink, and red, due to the scattering of light by atmospheric particles.\n3. **Dark Gray/Black**: At night, the sky can appear dark gray or black, although it can also be illuminated by the moon, stars, and artificial light sources.\n4. **Other conditions**: The color of the sky can also be affected by various atmospheric phenomena, such as:\n\t* Dust and pollution: can give the sky a hazy or brownish tint.\n\t* Clouds: can make the sky appear white or gray.\n\t* Fog: can create a white or grayish mist.\n\t* Aurora borealis (northern lights) or aurora australis (southern lights): can display vibrant, colorful patterns in the sky.\n\nSo, to summarize, the color of the sky is not always a simple answer, as it can change depending on the time of day, weather conditions, and other factors.",
