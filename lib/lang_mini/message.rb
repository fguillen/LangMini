This is because the Earth's atmosphere scatters the sunlight in all directions, with shorter (blue) wavelengths being scattered more than longer (red) wavelengths. This phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering.\n\nHowever, the color of the sky can change under different conditions:\n\n* During sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red, orange, pink, or purple due to the scattering of light by atmospheric particles.\n* On overcast days, the sky may appear gray or white due to the clouds blocking direct sunlight.\n* At night, the sky can appear dark, with stars and constellations visible due to the absence of direct sunlight.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the color of the sky is often blue, but it can change depending on the time of day and atmospheric conditions!"
